Repubikla - Beta
======================

[RepuBikla](http://repubikla.org/) is a crowdsourcing tool in development for the creation and centralization of data on non-motorized mobility in Mexico and elsewhere in the world. It aims to complement insufficient official information on non-motorized mobility and give a citizen approach with a database being built and strengthened progressively. The result is an assessment of the volume and diversity of cyclists commuting, intermodal, mobility group, infrastructure, cyclist accidents and insecurity in public space.

In the future Repubikla will be linked to apps and tools through an API.
The news of the project are published [here.](http://www.openstreetmap.mx/repubikla/).
