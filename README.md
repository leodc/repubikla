# RepuBikla - Alpha

RepuBikla is a crowdsourcing tool in development for the creation and centralization of data on non-motorized mobility in Mexico and elsewhere in the world.

It aims to complement insufficient official information on non-motorized mobility and give a citizen approach with a database being built and strengthened progressively. The result is an assessment of the volume and diversity of cyclists commuting, intermodal, mobility group, infrastructure, cyclist accidents and insecurity in public space.

Decision makers and civil society are equipped with a tool to promote and design better conditions for sustainable and safe mobility.

With the data collected will create and enhance optimal routing algorithms and other functions that can be accessed through APIs.

Offers tree mapping tools:
* Points
* Routes
* Zones
