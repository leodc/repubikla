======================

Software in development that with a crowdsourcing strategy seeks to generate and centralize data on non-motorized urban mobility, the objective is to complement official information and through [thematic maps](https://repubikla.carto.com/) offer a diagnostic of the citizen perception of the public space.

The news of the project are published [here.](http://www.openstreetmap.mx/repubikla/).
